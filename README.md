  ### Introduction
  In this presentation, I‚Äôll walk you through my analysis of pizza data, where I examined several aspects including ingredient combinations, pricing patterns, sales performance, and customer preferences. The goal was to identify trends and insights that could help improve product offerings or marketing strategies. To achieve this, I used SQL with a focus on subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs), which allowed me to break down complex queries and structure the analysis more efficiently. Let‚Äôs explore the key findings and what they reveal about the pizza business.

  ### Dataset Overview
  The dataset I used for this analysis is composed of four interconnected tables: orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types. The orders table contains information about each transaction, including order ID and date and time. Order_details breaks down each order into specific pizza items and quantities. The pizzas table includes details such as pizza size and price, while pizza_types provides information on the pizza category, name, and ingredients. Together, these tables form a comprehensive view of customer behavior, product variety, and sales performance, allowing for detailed analysis using joins, subqueries, and CTEs.

    The dataset I used for this analysis is composed of four interconnected tables: orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types. The orders table contains 21,350 rows, each representing a unique transaction with details such as order ID and date. The order_details table is the largest, consisting of 48,620 rows, and it breaks down each order into individual pizza items and quantities. The pizzas table contains 96 rows, providing details on the available pizza sizes and prices. The pizza_types table consists of 32 rows, describing each pizza‚Äôs name, category, and ingredients. Combined, these tables form a well-structured dataset that enables a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. For this project, I used SQL‚Äîleveraging joins, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)‚Äîto extract and interpret the data effectively.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
1. Importing the large csv file.
- order.csv file.

```sql
load data infile 'C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0\\Uploads\\orders.csv'
into table orders
fields terminated by ','
enclosed by ''
lines terminated by '\r\n'
ignore 1 lines;
```
- order_details.csv file
```sql
load data infile 'C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0\\Uploads\\order_details.csv'
into table order_details
fields terminated by ','
enclosed by ''
lines terminated by '\r\n'
ignore 1 lines;
```
2. Handling missing value from the four(4) tables.
```sql
select * from pizzas where pizza_id is null or pizza_type_id is null or size is null or price is null;
select * from pizza_types where pizza_type_id is null or name is null or category is null or ingredients is null;
select * from order_details where order_details_id is null or order_id is null or pizza_id is null or quantity is null;
select * from orders where order_id is null or date is null or time is null;
```
3. Checking for Duplicates record in orders table.
```sql
select order_id, count(*) from orders group by 1 having count(*) >1;
```

### Data Exploration and Insight
1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
```sql
select count(*) as total_number from orders;
```

2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
```sql
select round(sum(p.price * o.quantity),2) as total_revenue from pizzas as p join order_details as o on p.pizza_id=o.pizza_id;
```
Insight: The total revenue is #817,860.05

3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
```sql
select pi.name,p.price from pizza_types as pi join pizzas as p on pi.pizza_type_id=p.pizza_type_id order by 2 desc limit 1;
```

```sql
with size as (select pizza_id,case when pizza_id like '%s' then 'small' when pizza_id like '%m' then 'medium' when pizza_id like '%l' then 'large' end as size
from order_details)
select size, count(size) as order_number from size group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 1;
```
Insight: The most common pizza type order is Large size ordered 19,098 times.

5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

 - classic_dlx_m ordered 1159 times.

6. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
```sql
select pi.category,sum(o.quantity) as total_quantity from pizza_types as pi join pizzas as p on pi.pizza_type_id=p.pizza_type_id
join order_details as o on p.pizza_id=o.pizza_id group by 1;
```
Insght: They are

- Classic ordered 14888 times.
- Veggie ordered 11649 times.
- Supreme ordered 11987 times.
- Chicken ordered 11050 times.

7. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
```sql
with timming as(select time, case when hour(time) between 9 and 12 then 'morning' when hour(time) between 13 and 15 then 'afternoon' else 'evening'
end as distribution from orders)
select distribution, count(distribution) as total from timming group by 1 order by 2 desc;
```
Insight: In the morning 3760 orders are make while 5395 orders are make in the afternoon and 12195 orders in the evening.

8. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
```sql
select dayname(od.date),weekday(od.date) as weekday,round(avg(o.quantity),3) as avg from orders as od join order_details as o on od.order_id=o.order_id 
group by 1,2 order by weekday(od.date);
```

order_details as o on p.pizza_id=o.pizza_id group by pt.name),
total_rev as(select round(sum(revenue),2) as total_revenue from rev)
select name,concat(round(revenue*100/total_revenue,2),'','%') as percent from rev,total_rev order by 2 desc;
```
Insight: The Thai Chicken Pizza have the highest percentage of 5.31%

11. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
